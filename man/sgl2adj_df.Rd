\title{Format Sparse Group Lasso Coefficients into Gene/Pathway Adjacency Matrices}
\usage{
sgl2adj_df(gene_coefs, tissue_names = seq_along(gene_coefs))
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_coefs}{A list of coefficient vectors (e.g., from \code{sparsegl::cv.sparsegl()} or sgl_TWAS).
Each element should be a named numeric vector with coefficients for one tissue/condition.}

\item{tissue_names}{Character vector giving column names for each coefficient set.
Defaults to sequence along \code{gene_coefs}.}
}
\value{
A list with two data frames:
\describe{
\item{gene}{Gene × tissue/cell type adjacency matrix of summed effect sizes.}
\item{pathway}{Pathway × tissue/cell type adjacency matrix of summed effect sizes.}
}
}
\description{
Converts coefficient output from multiple Sparse Group Lasso (SGL) models
into two adjacency-matrix-like data frames:
\enumerate{
\item genes × tissues and
\item pathways × tissues.
}
}
\details{
For each SGL model, nonzero coefficients are parsed into gene and pathway
components. Coefficients belonging to the same gene or pathway are summed.
Intercepts are removed.
